              Hi! I'm Nizar Damiriyye. I'm a Computer Engineer & developer with
              a serious love for teaching. I am a founder of Creative Team
              Programming (C.T.P) and a Programmer & Instructor.
              <br />
              I am working online for the last 5 years and have created several
              successful websites running on the internet. I try to create a
              project-based course that helps you to learn professionally and
              makes you feel as a complete developer. Creative Team Programming
              exists to help you succeed in life.
              <br />
              Each course has been hand-tailored to teach a specific skill. I
              hope you agree! Whether you’re trying to learn a new skill from
              scratch or want to refresh your memory on something you’ve learned
              in the past, you’ve come to the right place.
            </p>
